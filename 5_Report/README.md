# Opportunities
The LMS spreads into previously uncharted territory, such as reading list repositories, learning systems, research data management, and so on. Furthermore, the future of library systems is likely to include a mix of open and closed systems, as well as local and shared (or hosted) services. With an increasing trend toward closed platforms (such as Facebook) and proprietary ecosystems (such as Apple), libraries will be required to navigate these various spaces and ecosystems.


# Threats:
Libraries now send and retrieve data from databases to help better manage inventory and the like, but some libraries lack the necessary data encryption practises. This frequently results in lost data and, in some cases, data that criminals can easily obtain.
